# CyberArk-UI
## Application to connect to your systems through CyberArk

Connect to your different systems more easily. The application is multi-user and can be run from a network share.

Authentication types:

- RADIUS
- LDAP

For LDAP authentication, you can encrypt your password from your profile window so that it isnÂ´t necessary to enter it at every connection. If you use RADIUS authentication, you can encrypt your PIN and only need to enter your TOKEN.

Available connections:

- RDP
- SSH
- WinSCP
- vSphere
- vSphere Web
- iDrac
- IMM

For SSH connections, if you prefer to use a local putty, you only need to add the executable in the path /AppData/PuTTy/putty.exe
